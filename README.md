Garage48 EduTech Hackathon project Button of Excellence


## Ideas/ TODO

* UI:
  # Central display with count of presses (and percentage of total compared to registered in group) in time window  (needs to have "reset" option since time window might need to change during class e.g multiple questions that have different times to answer)
  # Central display changes colour if context requires it upon hitting treshold
  # Configuration page that allows:
    - Creating and configuring contexts
    - adding/removing/editing users and groups
    -
  # Review that shows timeline of button presses (anonymous or unanonymous)
  # Tester tool that allows to generate x number of virtual buttons and press them with each press being registered by app
